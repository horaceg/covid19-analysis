## Mobility

Based on the work of to the reddit user _typhoidisbad_ on this [thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/datasets/comments/fuo64p/google_covid19_mobility_reports_time_series_data/), data from the Google mobility reports is available at:
- https://covid19-anaysis.netlify.com/mobility/world.csv for the world version: countries + regions
- https://covid19-anaysis.netlify.com/mobility/us.csv for the us version: states + counties

Note that data for the first two pages of the report, regarding the whole country or whole state, have a region (or county) set to `total`.
